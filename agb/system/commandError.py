Hey, {self.user.name}!

I just got your bug report, and will try to fix it soon!  Thanks for helping me squash those bugs!
People like you help AlphaGameBot be the Discord bot we all know it can be, and I couldn't do it without your bug reports!
Anyway, that command that gave you a hard time (`/{self.realinteraction.command}`) should be fixed soon.  While you wait, why not check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlphaGameDeveloper/AlphaGameBot/)?
