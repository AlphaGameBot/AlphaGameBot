## What is AlphaGameBot?
AlphaGameBot is a free and open-source Discord bot.  I got the inspiration to make AlphaGameBot when I was trying to find a good Discord bot that met my high requirements
* **100% Free.**  No Premium version, no purchases, and commands locked behind paywalls, just a functional, cool Discord bot for which we don't have to pay a million bucks.
* **Open-Source.** I am a strong supporter of Open-Source Software, and I would love for the Discord bot that I use to be open-source.
* **Good.**  No, seriously.  As much as I love to see developers make their own small bots, they don't have all the commands we take for granted.  Don't get me wrong--
Everyone should make their own Discord bots!  I love seeing their ideas and bots to play around with.  However, I wanted to make something that any server can use, enormous, big, medium, or small.

That led to the first version of AlphaGameBot.  I am still working on it with nearly every possible moment that I can, *(which is limited, sadly, as I am a high-school student)*
with the intent to make it the amazing bot that we all know it can be.

## How can I add it to my server?
I'm so glad you asked!  AlphaGameBot is available for *anyone* to add to their server.  All required information can be found on AlphaGameBot's webpage [here](https://alphagame.dev/alphagamebot)!

## Can I contribute?
Of course!  Any contribution, big or small, is very much welcome!  Check out my requirements for commits [here](https://alphagame.dev/alphagamebot/faq#can-i-contribute-to-alphagamebot).
